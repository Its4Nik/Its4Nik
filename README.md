DockStat is currently under development of a beta (since 1 year), there have been many challenges and hurdles over the development span.
The goal of the project is to completely get rid of the command line when working with docker across multiple hosts, while offering an extensible set of features.
Currently there are these features planned:
- Plugin support (backend and frontend)
  - official plugins:
    - Push Notifications
    - HA-Proxy + HA-Proxy Auto conf
    - Easy-Scale (Hetzner Cloud server scalling interface)
    - and many more to come
- Custom Themeing
- Stacks

The development of DockStat is rather slow, since I work on it by myself and never had anything to do with Web-Development, so it's quite a lot to learn :)

## ⛷️ Outside the Terminal...

When I’m not wrangling servers or coding, you’ll find me:
- Skiing down mountains
- Kite-surfing across waves
- Enjoying the thrill of sporty challenges!
